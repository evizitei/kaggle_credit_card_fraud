Trying to reproduce results from
and expert kaggler kernel:

https://www.kaggle.com/nschneider/gbm-vs-xgboost-vs-lightgbm

```{r}
library(pROC, quietly = TRUE)
library(microbenchmark, quietly = TRUE)

set.seed(42)

credit.card.data = read.csv("./data/creditcard.csv")
```

Data is loaded, now we'll split into train and
test data.

```{r}
train.test.split <- sample(2
  , nrow(credit.card.data)
  , replace = TRUE
  , prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
test = credit.card.data[train.test.split == 2, ]
```

```{r}
train = credit.card.data[train.test.split == 1, ]
```

So now we have a training set and a test set
randomly chosen at 70/30.
